## 👋 Hi, I’m Nidhi


I’m currently working as a Site Reliability Engineer (SRE) at Clarisights, with over 5 years of experience in building reliable, scalable, and secure systems.

My expertise spans across key areas of SRE, including:

🔹 Monitoring & Alerting

🔹 Incident Management & Reliability Engineering Practices

🔹 Google Cloud Platform (GCP) & AWS

🔹 CI/CD Pipelines & Automation

🔹 Kubernetes & Container Orchestration

🔹 Infrastructure as Code (Terraform, Helm, etc.)

When I’m not deep into infrastructure and systems, you’ll usually find me reading books 📚. I enjoy quiet time at home, with the occasional travel to break the routine ✈️. 

Here you’ll mostly find my experiments, learnings, and side projects as I tinker around with tools and ideas.

Right now, I’m also learning Go to better understand (and maybe even build) some of the tools I use every day 🛠️.
